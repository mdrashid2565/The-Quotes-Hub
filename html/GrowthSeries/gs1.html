        <div class="p">
            <p>Ever notice how the whole world seems against you when times are tough?</p><br>
            <p>You wake up late because your alarm clock doesn’t go off, you burn your breakfast, spill your coffee, or
                miss your train.</p><br>
            <p>One bad start seems to have a knock-on effect – until the whole day seems like a write-off, because just
                about everything that could go wrong, goes wrong.</p><br>

            <p><strong><b>
                        On the flip side, when you wake up on the right side of the bed, everything seems to magically
                        come together to your benefit.
                    </b></strong></p><br>
            <p>You find some extra cash you’d forgotten in your coat pocket. A parking space miraculously appears close
                to the door of your office. The girl or guy you’ve been interested in asks you out on a date after
                months of flirting.</p><br>
            <p>The thing is…</p><br>
            <p>It’s not that some days are more magical, or luckier, than others. <b>Your attitude (whether positive or
                    negative) is a direct reflection of what you predominantly think about, and you attract the kind of
                    energy you put out.</b></p><br>

            <p>Research suggests that happiness is a choice that anyone can make. So it’s not that the world treats you
                differently, it is you who chooses to see the world differently. Positively, and in a new light.</p><br>

            <p>As Psychologist William James puts it:</p><br>

            <p>The greatest discovery of any generation is that a human can alter his life by altering his attitude.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Even when times are tough, being and feeling positive is a choice that you can make. We know how hard
                that can be – especially when you’re getting started. That’s why we’ve put together this list of tips
                designed to help you boost your positivity.</p><br>

            <p><b>So read on, and find out how you can change your life and mindset – and focus on being positive, all
                    the time.

            <h2>
                <a id="Contents1">1. Eat good, wholesome food</a>
            </h2><br>
            <p><b>What you eat</b> plays a crucial role in how much energy your body produces, which in turn affects
                your levels of mental energy and focus.</p><br>

            <p>According to <font color="#3baee2">Mind </font>(a mental health charity based in the UK), improving your
                diet can promote positive feelings, clearer thinking, calmer moods, and increased energy.</p><br>

            <p><b>Even with no other changes, eating healthy, nutritious, whole foods can boost your positivity and help
                    shift your outlook.</b></p><br>

            <p>According to one study, vitamin deficiencies can cause a decline in mental health leading to stress,
                anxiety, depression, addictions, and other psychological disorders.</p><br>

            <p>Eating a healthy balanced diet of foods rich in vitamins, minerals, protein, fibre, and antioxidants can
                actually help increase the cognitive function of your brain, keeping you alert, and lifting your mood.
            </p><br>

            <p>Though it’s not easy to change your diet and break bad habits (Friday night takeaway, anyone?), getting
                organized is the first step to success. Creating – and sticking to – a meal plan can help keep your
                fridge stocked with healthy meals and snacks, and you on track for success.</p><br>

            <p>The benefits of regular exercise aren’t just visible when we look in the mirror.</p><br>

            <p>A Christian, Vujicic dealt with bullying for much of his life, but after this Australian began to give
                talks
                at
                his prayer group, he quickly became an inspiration for all those around him.</p><br>

            <p>He has since released several motivational books and moved to California to support his thriving career
                as a
                motivational speaker. If you want to hear from someone who has beaten all the odds to claim greatness,

            <p>ET the Hip Hop Preacher is one of the first motivational speakers to capitalize on YouTube to build a
                multimillion-dollar speaking business.</p><br>

            <p><a href="https://ericthomas.com/" target="_blank">Eric Thomas</a> has an incredible story. After coming
                from
                a
                rough area of Detroit and a single-parent home, he spent
                time homeless on the streets and was inspired by his Pastor to change his life.</p><br>

            <p>After many grueling years of hard work, he not only went back to high school to get his GED, he went on
                to

            <h2><a id="Contents4">4. Try Hypnosis</a></h2><br>
            <p>If you’re looking to build a business and want a speaker who can push you to believe that anything is
                possible,
                Grant Cardone is the one to follow.</p><br>

            <p>He is another speaker who has been profitable from the Digital Age, building a $750 million empire with a
                sales-focused business. He is known for his high-energy and no holds barred approach to sales and
                marketing.
            </p><br>

            <p>He now has his own sales training, Cardone University, which teaches entrepreneurs to be fearless in
                sales,
                negotiations, cold calling, and closing. His programs are expensive, but you can find dozens of hours of

                content for free on YouTube.</p><br>
            <h2><a id="Contents5">5. Surround yourself with positive people</a></h2><br>
            <p><a href="https://www.drwaynedyer.com/" target="_blank">Wayne Dyer</a> helped birth the modern self-help
                movement
                with his first book, Your Erroneous Zones, selling over 35
                million copies. He spent most of his early life in an orphanage, going on to work as a professor of
                counseling
                psychology at St. John’s University in New York City.</p><br>

            <p>After his academic lectures began to gain popularity for their focus on positive thinking, he was
                contacted
                by a
                literary agent. Dyer’s first book was a huge success, and he went on to write dozens of other books,
                including
                many best sellers.</p><br>

            <p>He was highly influenced by Eastern Philosophy and is a great speaker to follow if you are interested in
                psychology and spirituality.Though he passed away in 2015, you can still see many of his lectures on
                YouTube
                and
                his books continue to be widely popular.</p><br>
            <h2><a id="Contents6"> 6. Reflect on positive things</a></h2><br>
            <p>If speakers like Wayne Dyer birthed the modern motivational speaker, Tony Robbins perfected the
                blueprint. By
                far
                the most successful speaker of all time, Robbins’ early books, such as Unlimited Power and Awaken the
                Giant
                Within, helped catapult him to stardom and build several companies valued at over $6 billion in annual
                sales.
            </p><br>

            <p>His <b>High-Energy Lectures</b> use principles from Neurolinguistic Programming and popular psychology to
                inspire
                audiences worldwide. He is also widely known for his philanthropic endeavors, and his teachings are
                typically
                focused on health, wealth, and living a balanced life.</p><br>

            <p>If you are feeling low in energy and want someone to pull you out of a rut, Tony Robbins is a great
                speaker
                to
                listen to; his audiobooks have definitely stood the test of time.</p><br>
