						<h1><b>MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES</b></h1>

				</u>
			</center>

			<center>
				<p><u><b>Motivation:-</b></u>"Motivation" is commonly defined as what explains why people or animals
					initiate, continue or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time. Motivational states come in
					various degrees of strength. The higher the degree, the more likely it is that the state has an
					influence on behavior. This is often linked to forces acting from within the agent that result in
					goal-directed behavior. One problem with defining motivation in terms of internal forces is that it
					is very difficult to measure them, which is why empirically-minded theorists often prefer
					definitions that are more closely linked to observable behavior.One approach is to define motivation
					in terms of the flexibility of the animal's behavior. This flexibility involves goal-directed
					behavior that changes as the animal learns through new experiences Rats, for example, can learn to
					traverse through complicated mazes in order to satisfy their hunger. The feeding behavior of flies,
					on the other hand, is not flexible in this sense. On this view, we are justified to ascribe
					motivational states to rats but not to flies. But it has been argued that there are cases of
					motivation without flexible behavior. A totally paralyzed person, for example, could still have
					motivation despite being unable to engage in behavior. This means that flexibility may still be a
					sufficient but not a necessary mark of motivation. Some definitions stress the continuity between
					human and animal motivation but others draw a clear distinction between the two. This is often
					motivated by the idea that human agents act for reasons and commit themselves to the intentions they
					form while animals just follow their strongest desire. Causalist definitions stress the causal
					relation between motivation and the resulting behavior. Non-causalist definitions, on the other
					hand, hold that motivation explains behavior in a non-causal way.</p>

				<p>Music can be as powerful a motivator as motivational quotes.</p><br>
				<p>Each morning when you wake up, play a few pump-up songs</p>
				<p> before you start your day toget you going. You can listen to</p>
				<p> productivity music on Spotify to help you get going. By getting in
				<p></p> the right mindset, you can inch closer to motivating yourself.</p><br>
				<p>When I want to get in the zone, I listen to “Time” by Hans Zimmer,</p>
				<p> which has no lyrics but has an intensity that helps me focus. If I'm</p>
				<p> feeling like I’m in a rut, motivational songs like “You’re a Superstar”</p>
				<p> by Love Inc. pick me up.</p><br><br>

				<p>When you think of your big goal, sometimes you start feeling</p>
				<p> overwhelmed. Why? Because big goals don’t get achieved right</p>
				<p> away. Instead, create mini-goals to help excite you along the way. This way,</p>
				<p> you can be more goal oriented and build a habit of being more effective.</p><br>
				<p>Celebrating your small wins will help you stay motivated through</p>
				<p> your journey. Plus, celebrating is always super fun. Maybe you</p>
				<p> break your goal down to 10 small-sized goals with tasks that get</p>
				<p> you on track to achieve them.</p><br>
				<p>For each of the 10 goals, you can add a small celebration. Maybe a</p>
				<p> glass of champagne for one or a dessert with a sparkler on top for</p>
				<p> another. Don’t forget to check out some of our motivational quotes</p>
				<p> about success.</p><br><br>

					<p>American entrepreneur John Rohn once said, “You’re the average</p>
					<p> of the five people you spend the most time with.” Whether or not</p>
					<p> that’s true is debatable. The reality is being around the right kind</p>
					<p> of people can only help you grow.</p><br>
					<p>If you’re surrounded by those who love your ambition, you’ll be</p>
					<p> more ambitious and achieve more. If you’re surrounded by loved</p>
					<p> ones who tell you your goals are stupid and tell you to change</p>
					<p> them, use that as motivation to prove them wrong.</p><br>
					<p>Be around those who help you feel comfortable being</p>
					<p> the ambitious, go-getter you are, so you can become the successful</p>
					<p> person you’re meant to be.</p><br><br>
