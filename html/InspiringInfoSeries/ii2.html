            <p>Here at Keepinspiring.me, we define inspiration as follows: Inspiration is when you feel a deep-rooted
                passion and motivation to do something.</p><br>

            <p>We are all inspired by different things and in different ways. Yet, inspiration is all around you and can
                appear at a moment’s notice.</p><br>

            <p>For example:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>You may see a young man helping an elderly woman with her groceries and get inspired to help others.
                </li><br>

                <li>You may see your good friend order Mexican food in Spanish and get inspired to learn a new language.
                </li><br>

                <li>You may read an inspirational quote and get inspired to finish your work/school project.</li><br>
                <p>The trick is to learn how to tap into this inspiration that’s constantly around you all the time…</p>
                <br>
            </ul>

            <h2>
                <a id="HowtoDiscoverInspiration">How to Discover Inspiration</a>
            </h2><br>
            <p>Now, to help you discover your inspiration, we’ve broken things down into these five easy-to-follow
                steps:</p><br>

            <p><a id="Observeyoursurroundings">Step 1. Observe your surroundings</a></p><br>
            <div>
                <img class="img1" src="/images/ObserveSurrounding.jpg" alt="Observe your surrounding">
            </div><br>

            <p>To become inspired, you need to observe your surroundings. As we mentioned before, opportunities to
                become inspired are happening all the time; you just need to be aware of them. So, try observing your
                surroundings instead of texting with your friend on the phone or checking Facebook. Look around, watch
                what other people are doing, and get involved.</p><br>

            <p><a id="Tapintoyouremotions">Step 2. Tap into your emotions</a></p><br>
            <div>
                <img class="img1" src="/images/Tapintoyouremotions.jpg" alt="Tap into your emotions">
            </div><br>
            <p>You’ll also need to tap into your emotions about how you see things happening. If something makes you
                feel good, motivated, and inspired, then do it.</p><br>

            <p><a id="Takeaction"></a>Step 3. Take action</a></p><br>
            <div>
                <img class="img1" src="/images/Takeaction.jpg" alt="Take action">
            </div><br>
            <p>The moment you feel inspired, take action immediately. Don’t wait a minute, day, or week to get started.
                If you feel inspired to learn something, sign up for a class right away. Email someone who can help you
                get started if you feel inspired to do something.</p><br>

            <p><a id="Startsmall">Step 4. Start small</a></p><br>
            <div>
                <img class="img1" src="/images/Startsmall.jpg" alt="Start small">
            </div><br>
            <p>If you’re just starting to tap into your inspiration, start small. Gandhi, Mother Theresa, and Eisenstein
                didn’t change the world in a day. They made small changes and slowly built on them.</p><br>

            <p><a id="Keepitup">Step 5. Keep it up</a></p><br>

            <div>
                <img class="img1" src="/images/Keepitup.jpg" alt="Keep it up">
            </div><br>
            <p>Inspiration looks and feels a little different for everyone. It’s when that inner flame kicks in, and you
                feel that passion and motivation to do something. And if you start doing something and that flame burns
                out, don’t worry; keep trying and revisit that initial thought and feeling when you were first inspired.
            </p><br>


            <h2>
                <a id="ExamplesOfInspiration">Examples Of Inspiration</a>
            </h2><br>
            <p>
            <h3> <a id="People"></a> People</h3>
            </p><br>

            <p>As human beings, we tend to model ourselves after others as we are commonly inspired by people’s bravery,
                kindness, creativity, and other amazing traits. Some people are inspired by those with a higher social
                status, while others are inspired and influenced by famous people, close friends, or family members.</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>An Example:</b> Teachers change lives and inspire their students each day. When a student is inspired
                by their teacher or an inspiring person, they can accomplish great things and gain the motivation they
                need to move forward in a positive direction toward their goals.</p><br>

            <p>Elon Musk, for example, was encouraged and inspired by Richard Feynman, a famous American theoretical
                physicist who gave lectures and wrote books on physics. Elon Musk also grew up around engineering and
                science.</p><br>

            <h3><a id="ArtandCulture">Art and Culture</a></h3><br>
            <p>Many are also inspired by talented artists and the visual expression of culture and artistic inspiration.
                When we turn to art and culture for design inspiration or a new idea, it allows us to travel to
                different perspectives and experience something we may not have experienced prior. Art and culture can
                inspire creativity and innovative thinking.</p><br>

            <p><b>An Example:</b> When we walk our favorite art exhibits or admire culture and artwork in general, the
                right side of our brain takes what it sees and expands on that. <br><br>

                When we stare into a painting of a forest, our brain can envision us actually doing this. This allows
                creative people to look beyond the painting’s frame and imagine what else is out there. <br><br>

                A great example of this was Steve Jobs. He had dropped out of college and made a pilgrimage through
                India, hoping to find enlightenment and divine guidance. However, the Japanese path of Zen Buddhism
                ultimately awakened his sensibilities. He looked at Zen culture as a deep influence.
            </p><br>

            <h3><a id="Nature">Nature</a></h3><br>
            <p>Nature can also inspire people as it reflects our natural environment. Spending more time in nature
                allows us to experience a sense of awe and astonishment. We are no longer pressured by time and take
                things in stride. Nature also provides lessons we can learn from. <br><br>

                <b>An Example:</b> When in nature, human beings are guided by divine inspiration. Breathe through your
                nose and out of your mouth. Experience the sun shining on you and discover how bright the day really is.
                <br><br>

                Velcro was actually invented by someone who was inspired by nature. The inspiration for Velcro came from
                the thistle’s hooked barbs. George de Mestral was a swiss engineer who noticed how the barbs stuck to
                his clothing and dog in 1948. After studying this, he discovered how an interlocking system could be
                used to design Velcro.
            </p><br>

            <h3><a id="Music">Music</a></h3><br>
            <p>Music is considered pure and unadulterated inspiration and can influence our emotions, ideas, creativity,
                and energy. Music has the most effect on people ready to listen to it. Listening carefully and paying
                attention to the composition can inspire people while healing their bodies. Inspiring music also spurs
                intellectual activity. <br> <br>
                <b>An Example:</b> Russian abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky was heavily inspired by music. He began
                playing the violin at a young age and revealed just how much music had inspired him in a performance of
                Richard Wagner’s Lohengrin at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. <br> <br>

                Andy Warhol, a pop artist, was also heavily inspired and influenced by music. He was a fan of The Velvet
                Underground between 1965 and 1967. He even provided them with artwork they would use on their album
                covers.
