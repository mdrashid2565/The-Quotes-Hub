		<center><p><font size="5"><u><b>Inspirational quotes:-</b></u></font>Inspirational quotes can help motivate us and create a positive outlook on life and work when we need it most. </p><p>They do so by harnessing the power of positive thinking. Reframing our brains to think positively is a key step in leading a happy and</p><p>successful life.</p></center><br>
		<center><p>You make a choice when you decide how you will react to any given situation. If you’re choosing (sometimes subconsciously)</p><p> to complain and think negatively, your natural reaction will be to dwell on the negatives of every situation.</p></center><br>
		<center><p>When you actively choose to think positively, regardless of how absolutely ridiculous it may seem, you will turn the situation </p><p>into a development plan for growth, helping you become a better problem-solver and leader. Over time and after reframing</p><p> your mind to think positively about problems, you’ll stay motivated, inspired, and empowered to take on any challenge</p><p> that comes your way!</p></center><br>
		<center><br><p>While reading through this list of the best motivational quotes in English, I recommend writing down some of the best</p><p> inspirational and motivational quotes that resonate with you and your current situation. After writing them down, find the </p><p> most motivational thought or the most inspiring passage, read it out loud, and then really try to understand the meaning.</p></center>
