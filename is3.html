        <h1 align="center">11 Books for Female Entrepreneurs</h1>
        <p>Need some encouragement as a business owner? These 11 books for female entrepreneurs are a great way to get
            inspired and stay focused.</p>
        <p>This might be a man’s world, but women are increasingly leading the way when it comes to business.</p>
        <p>Women may make up 47% of the American workforce, but they are woefully under-represented in leadership
            positions. The 2018 Fortune 500 list featured only 24 female CEOs.</p>
        <p>However, as of 2018, there are<b>12.3 million women-owned businesses</b> in the U.S., compared to just
            402,000 in 1972. That equates to about <b>1 in 4 businesses.</b></p>
        <p>A SCORE report recently found that women are slightly more likely to start a business than men – which
            probably accounts for the reason that the number of women-owned businesses has increased by 58% since 2007.
        </p>
        <p>Whether you’re a woman with a business idea that you aren’t sure how to market, are fresh out of college and
            wanting to find a direction of your own, or just want to know more about what it takes to make a dream
            reality, we’ve compiled a list of the very best books for female entrepreneurs.</p>

                <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <p>Grace Bonney worked tirelessly to build her own online company, Design*Sponge, before she decided
                        to help other women follow in her footsteps. In 2006, she founded the Design*Sponge Biz Ladies
                        series, a traveling event that connects women who run their own design-based businesses with
                        free legal, financial, and marketing advice.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these events and contributing to magazines like House & Garden, Grace hosts a
                        weekly radio show called “After the Jump.” She has also founded a scholarship to support up and
                        coming designers.</p>
                    <p>In the Company of Women is compendium of interviews with more than 100 female entrepreneurs, from
                        designers to bakers, activists, tattooists, comedians, and hoteliers. None of the interviews are
                        particularly long, making this a book that you can dip in and out of at will. Beautifully
                        published and featuring vibrant photography, Bonney’s book truly celebrates the diversity of
                        women in business.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Full of practical advice and inspirational suggestions, In the Company of Women is the perfect guide for
                those who are looking to forge their own path. The interviews touch on what women consider to be their
                keys to success (from going with your gut instinct, to maintaining meaningful relationships along the
                way), highlight the importance of daily rituals (creating a daily to-do list, or finding time to
                meditate), and provide advice for a new generation of female entrepreneurs.</p>
            <p>This isn’t a book that tells you that everything is going to be fine, but a series of accounts by
                talented women who have succeeded in business despite deep adversity and vulnerability.</p>
            <p>This is the perfect book for teen girls, girls fresh out of college, and women seeking a push to turn a
                passion into a career. The beautiful pictures of women in their own workspaces also make it the perfect
                coffee table book, whether at home or at the office.</p>

                <img src="/images/book21.jpeg" alt="shark tales book">
                <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <p>Published in 2011, Shark Tales is the inspiring true story of Barbara Corcoran, the businesswoman
                        who made a name for herself on the ABC show Shark Tank.</p>
                    <p>Now the founder of the Corcoran Group, New York’s premier real estate company, Corcoran is one of
                        the most powerful brokers in the nation, but this wasn’t always the case.</p>
                    <p>She failed at twenty-two jobs before borrowing $1,000 from a boyfriend, quitting her job as a
                        diner waitress, and starting a tiny real estate office in New York City.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Corcoran’s story is simultaneously inspiring and approachable, because she is able to admit her failures
                and explain how she built on them.</p>
            <p>She interweaves the highs and lows of building the business, from publishing a real estate report to gain
                recognition to the necessity of taking a second job, with the lessons she learned from her homemaker mom
                and the nine siblings she grew up with in New Jersey.</p>
            <p>Shark Tales receives excellent online reviews for good reason. While some people use writing a memoir as
                an activity to fill time after selling the company that made them a fortune, Barbara Corcoran seems to
                have found it a genuinely illuminating and soul-searching exercise.</p>
            <p>It’s an easy read, but it’s packed full of advice about dressing the part, harnessing your passion, doing
                your homework, and distinguishing yourself from the crowd. Whether you’re a fan of Shark Tank, or have
                no idea who Corcoran is, it doesn’t matter. There’s advice here for everyone.</p>

                <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <p>As co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post, Arianna Huffington knows a thing or two
                        about effective communication. She has authored 15 books, was included in Time Magazine’s list
                        of the world’s 100 most influential people, and made the Forbes Most Powerful Women list.</p>
                    <p>Thrive was published in 2014 as a prelude to Thrive Global: “a corporate and consumer well-being
                        and productivity platform with the mission of changing the way we work and live by ending the
                        collective delusion that burnout is the price we must pay for success.”</p>
                    <p>Thrive begins with an incident that made Arianna Huffington question the price of success: a
                        broken cheekbone and a gash under her eye, caused by a fall she had due to lack of sleep and
                        total exhaustion.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Though she was managing one of the fastest-growing media companies in the world, appearing on magazine
                covers, and making all the right lists, Huffington was also beginning to realize that living a
                “successful life” could take its toll.</p>
            <p>The aim of Huffington’s work is to show us that the more we pursue the bigger salary, a corner office,
                and more authority, the more we are “rewarded” with burnout and stress-related illnesses. When we spend
                more of our time trying to be successful, we are actually chipping away at the quality of our
                relationships, our family life, and, ironically, our careers.</p>
            <p>Though Thrive is essentially a self-help book, it is also a deeply personal memoir in which Arianna talks
                candidly about her own struggles. Success is a relative concept when you are juggling deadlines, a
                blossoming career, and an often hectic home life.</p>
            <p>Her message highlights the importance of mindfulness, unplugging from the world, and making time to give
                to others. With a healthy work/life balance, Arianna Huffington is nonetheless a powerful and inspiring
                example of a woman who turned a dream into an incredibly successful reality.</p>

                <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <p>Forget the Netflix series, the original Girl Bosses turn to Sophia Amoruso’s book for advice from
                        this thoroughly modern entrepreneur.</p>
                    <p>Part business advice, part memoir, #GirlBoss tells us the story of how Sophia went from opening
                        an eBay store when she was bored to founding the successful business she runs today.</p>
                    <p>You don’t have to like or be familiar with Nasty Gal to find the wisdom and humor in this book.
                        Like the series, you’ll probably find yourself bingeing on Amoruso’s book.</p>
                    <p>After spending her teen years hitchhiking, committing petty theft, and scrounging in dumpsters
                        for leftover bagels, it’s unsurprising that by twenty-two Sophia had dropped out of school, was
                        broke, directionless, and checking IDs in the lobby of an art school.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>When she started selling vintage clothes on eBay, she never dreamed she’d be the successful founder of
                one business and the CEO of another. #GirlBoss sounds like the specific story of one female entrepreneur
                as she finds her way in the world, but it actually has advice that is applicable to many situations.</p>
            <p>Sophia reminds us that success in business is all about trusting your instincts and following your gut;
                knowing which rules to follow and which to break; or in Sophia’s words, “when to button up and when to
                let your freak flag fly.”</p>
            <p>If there’s one lesson Amoruso has for all girlbosses, it’s that successful entrepreneurs always play to
                their strengths. This is an easy, riveting, but somewhat divisive read.</p>
            <p>Amazon reviews demonstrate that you’ll either love this book or you’ll hate it (but if you do love it, I
                highly recommend checking out The Girlboss Workbook: An Interactive Journal for Winning at Life and
                Sophia Amoruso’s weekly podcast).</p>

                    <p>I’d argue that one of the books of 2018 was by Rachel Hollis, the TV personality, motivational
                        speaker, and CCO of The Hollis Company.</p>
                    <p>If you liked Girl, Wash Your Face, you’re going to love her latest book, Girl, Stop Apologizing.
                        It’s all about helping women to fulfill their potential by telling them to stop worrying about
                        falling short of perfection.</p>

                    <p>Rachel Hollis is humble, honest, and sincere in thanking her readers for her success. Her writing
                        style is captivating and approachable, and she is beautifully blunt at times. Girl, Stop
                        Apologizing is full of actionable ideas that serve as a wake-up call for every woman: to stop
                        talking yourself out of your dreams, to let go of excuses, and to believe in yourself.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Hollis talks frankly about her own experiences as a wife, mother of four, daughter, and employee, and
                encourages women to stop defining themselves by roles that are characterized by relationships to other
                people. Her encouraging guide is all about instructing women to own who they are and go after what they
                really want.</p>
            <p>Whatever your dreams, goals, or current situation, Hollis has advice on adopting behaviors, acquiring
                skills, and growing in confidence. She teaches everything you need to get out of your comfort zone and
                start living a more fulfilling life.</p>
            <p>So whether you’re going for a promotion that you haven’t have the courage to apply for, or are keen to
                start your own business, it’s time to start fulfilling your potential.</p>

                    <p>Another compilation of informative interviews, Mistakes I Made at Work quickly entered the “Top
                        10 Business Books” list when it was published in Spring 2014. Editor Jessica Bacal interviews
                        twenty-five successful women about their toughest on-the-job moments and allows them to reflect
                        on what went wrong, why, and what they’d do differently.</p>
                    <p>The women come from a variety of different backgrounds and fields, from Stanford psychology
                        professor Carol Dweck to bestselling author Cheryl Strayed.</p>
                    <p>Whatever your working environment looks like – from starting up an Etsy shop in your guest room,
                        to meeting with a team of 30 employees – being able to recognize your faults and learn from your
                        mistakes is an essential part of being a female entrepreneur.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The women included in Mistakes I Made at Work demonstrate all the ways that their mistakes made them more
                thoughtful, purposeful, and assertive as leaders. Given a do-over, these women would tell you that they
                are better at their jobs now than they would’ve been if they’d never made a mistake at all.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re just starting out in the world of work, are looking to advance your career, or could just
                use some good old-fashioned female solidarity, Jessica Bacal’s book is a valuable resource for women
                looking for the confidence to negotiate salary, looking for work that reflects your passions, balancing
                work life and family life, or contemplating promotion.</p>
            <p>This is definitely the kind of book that you’ll want to pass on and share with your friends, whether you
                met them at work or in the playground.</p>

                    <p>Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, Sheryl Sandberg</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div style="display: flex;align-items: center;justify-content: space-between;">
                <img src="/images/book20.jpeg" alt="Lean in book">
                <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <p>Number 6 on the 2019 Fortune Most Powerful Women in Business list, Sheryl Sandberg is the chief
                        operating officer (COO) of Facebook.</p>
                    <p>Way back in 2010, Sandberg gave a TED talk entitled “Why We Have Too Few Women Leaders” on the
                        way women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Now viewed over six million
                        times, her talk encouraged women to “sit at the table,” seek challenges, take risks, and pursue
                        their goals with gusto.</p>
                    <p>Lean In is a continuation of the conversation Sandberg started almost a decade ago. She combines
                        personal experience, collected data, and compelling research, to change the focus from what
                        women can’t do to what they can.</p>
                    <p>Along with anecdotes from her own experiences in business, the book offers a good amount of
                        practical advice on negotiation techniques, seeking mentorship, and building a satisfying
                        career.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Though on the face of it, Lean In might seem like a book for women who want to follow a conventional
                career path, Sandberg’s advice is also relevant to those female entrepreneurs looking to strike out on
                their own.</p>
            <p>It’s full of actionable steps to professional achievement and personal fulfillment, and provides a
                refreshing take on the need for men to support women both in the workplace and at home.</p>
            <p><b>The one thing that successful female entrepreneurs have in common? A great network of people to
                    support them.</b></p>
            <p>Not everyone is going to love this book. Sure, Sandberg has lots of great things to say about the need
                for women to feel emboldened and impassioned to follow their dreams – but she also has an army of staff
                at home to look after her kids, clean her home, and fill her refrigerator.</p>
            <p>If you can look past the disparities between “us” and “them,” there is some solid advice from a woman who
                has faced a whole host of professional obstacles – and won.</p>

                    <p>Year of Yes: How to Dance It Out, Stand in the Sun and Be Your Own Person, Shona Rhimes</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div style="display: flex;align-items: center;justify-content: space-between;">
                <img src="/images/book26.jpg" alt="Year of YES">
                <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <p>You probably know Shona Rhimes as the creator of such shows as Greys Anatomy and Scandal, but her
                        successful facade belies a very real reluctance for the limelight.</p>
                    <p>With three hit TV shows and three children, Rhimes had multiple reasons to say “No” to Hollywood
                        parties, speaking engagements, and media appearances. But saying no to these unique experiences
                        may have put her in a position where she had nothing to lose, but she had nothing to fear
                        either.</p>
                    <p>Year of Yes is all about Shonda’s response to a challenge set by her sister: just for a year, to
                        try and say YES to the unexpected invitations that came her way. Though she was initially
                        reluctant to accept, Rhimes quickly realized the transformative effect of saying yes to the new
                        opportunities that came her way.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This isn’t a self-help book, it’s definitely more of a relatable memoir. As one reviewer commented,
                Rhimes is “wiser, funnier, and cooler than your average therapist – she’s also been there, if “there” is
                the land of the angry, scared and emotionally dysfunctional.”</p>
            <p>If you’re looking for relatable reading that is all about overcoming your fear of trying new things, and
                the effect that changing your attitude can have on your relationships (spoiler: it isn’t always good!),
                Year of Yes is the book for you.</p>
            <p>While this book isn’t really about business, the premise of Rhimes’ memoir is still an extremely valuable
                one. Taking the leap from having an idea to actually starting a business can be extremely scary, and
                cause a lot of soul-searching in the process.</p>
            <p>Learning to say yes to new things – especially when they push you out of your comfort zone and force you
                to mingle with new people – is an important part of the journey.</p>

                <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <p>Published in 2014, The Confidence Code is a follow-up to Kay and Shipman’s bestselling book,
                        Womenomics. It’s an informative and practical guide to understanding the importance of
                        confidence – as well as learning how to achieve it – for women at any stage of their career.</p>
                    <p>Though working women today are better educated and more well-qualified than they ever have been,
                        men still predominate in the corporate world. Shipman and Kay argue that the key reason for this
                        is confidence, or rather, a lack of it.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The Confidence Code is really a reaction to books like Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In, combining cutting-edge
                research in genetics, gender, behavior, and cognition with personal examples from their own lives and
                the lives of other successful women; to go beyond telling women to just “be more confident” and showing
                them how to actually do it.</p>
            <p>The Confidence Code is different from many of the other books on my list, because it’s less about
                personal stories and more about scientific research.</p>
            <p>From how our DNA influences us to the necessity of breaking out of the destructive behaviors we learn in
                childhood, this is a book packed full of information and advice for female entrepreneurs in need of a
                confidence boost.</p>

                <div style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <p>Being a successful entrepreneur requires ideas, and lots of them. It also requires the ability to
                        know when to forgo that idea and move on with another. Claudia Azula Altucher is the Wall Street
                        Journal bestselling writer of The Power of No, a podcast host, and yoga teacher.</p>
                    <p>Become An Idea Machine is all about flexing your “idea muscle” – an essential part of your brain
                        when it comes to thinking quickly, solving problems creatively, and coming up with new ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>This book is definitely more of a workbook than an actual read, but it has months of daily
                        prompts to help you flex your idea muscle and come up with 10 new ideas each day.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The exercises push you to think differently and come up with new ways of viewing situations,
                opportunities, and ideas.</p>
            <p>It’s the perfect New Years Resolution aid, or a gift for a friend who is looking to go in a new
                direction. Having ideas and translating them into the actionable steps required to start a new business
                are two very different things – but you’ve got to have the idea to make a start.</p>
            <p>As Azula Altucher says, “When a GREAT idea comes your way you are inspired, you feel moved, you HAVE to
                take the next step. Execution happens automatically.”</p>

            <p>Wagman-Geller’s empowering biographies are deftly woven together to create a picture of how these amazing
