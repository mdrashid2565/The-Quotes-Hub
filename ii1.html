                <p>Powerful orators have always been able to sway an audience. Here are the 21 best motivational
                    speakers
                    who
                    carry
                    on that tradition.</p><br>
                <p>From Martin Luther King to Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln, those who can communicate messages
                    with
                    clarity
                    and emotion often rise to positions of power and authority.</p><br>
                <p>However, political movements are not the only domain in which speakers can influence your psychology
                    and
                    change
                    your mind. Over the last century, in particular, we&#39;ve seen the widespread commercialization of
                    motivational
                    speakers.</p><br>
                <p>These people inspire us to question, push, and reinvent ourselves. They allow us to gain realizations
                    about
                    our
                    nature and potential, which we may have otherwise been unable to develop on our own.</p><br>
                <p><strong><b>
                            While they often have books, the power of the spoken word cannot be understated.
                        </b></strong></p><br>
                <p>We can learn lessons from their lives and begin to believe in ourselves as they encourage us to
                    embody
                    our
                    beliefs. It may sound cliche, but the line between success and failure is slim and often purely a
                    psychological
                    barrier.</p><br>
                <p>By listening to these individuals, you can break through that mental barrier and achieve things you
                    never
                    thought
                    possible. So here are the 21 the best motivational speakers you should follow today.

                <h2>
                    <a id="LisaNichols"> 1. Lisa Nichols</a>
                </h2><br>
                <p><a href="https://motivatingthemasses.com/about/lisa-nichols/">Lisa Nichols</a> is an inspiration for
                    single
                    moms
                    everywhere. With literally nothing to her name and living in an
                    abusive relationship, she was able to climb out of poverty by using her voice. Through her coaching
                    and
                    speaking, she has been able to touch millions of lives.
                </p>

                <p>If you feel like you’re being weighed down and held back by your financial situation, Lisa is the
                    perfect
                    speaker
                    to inspire you to overcome the psychological restraints holding you back. Her charisma and
                    positivity
                    make
                    her a
                    joy to listen to.</p><br>

                <h2>
                    <a id="NickVujicic">2. Nick Vujicic</a>
                </h2><br>
                <p>This speaker doesn’t fit the stereotypical image of a motivational guru. Nick Vujicic was born with
                    tetra-amelia
                    syndrome, an incredibly rare condition that meant he came into the world without either arms or
                    legs. In
                    fact,
                    it is so rare, he is believed to be one of only seven other people living with the syndrome.</p><br>

                <p>A Christian, Vujicic dealt with bullying for much of his life, but after this Australian began to
                    give
                    talks
                    at
                    his prayer group, he quickly became an inspiration for all those around him.</p><br>

                <p>He has since released several motivational books and moved to California to support his thriving
                    career
                    as a
                    motivational speaker. If you want to hear from someone who has beaten all the odds to claim
                    greatness,
                    you’ll
                    want to listen to his incredible talks and motivational quotes.</p><br>

                <p>ET the Hip Hop Preacher is one of the first motivational speakers to capitalize on YouTube to build a
                    multimillion-dollar speaking business.</p><br>

                <p><a href="https://ericthomas.com/" target="_blank">Eric Thomas</a> has an incredible story. After

                    rough area of Detroit and a single-parent home, he spent
                    time homeless on the streets and was inspired by his Pastor to change his life.</p><br>

                <p>After many grueling years of hard work, he not only went back to high school to get his GED, he went
                    on
                    to
                    get a

                    Grant Cardone is the one to follow.</p><br>

                <p>He is another speaker who has been profitable from the Digital Age, building a $750 million empire
                    with a
                    sales-focused business. He is known for his high-energy and no holds barred approach to sales and
                    marketing.

                <p><a href="https://www.drwaynedyer.com/" target="_blank">Wayne Dyer</a> helped birth the modern
                    self-help
                    movement
                    with his first book, Your Erroneous Zones, selling over 35
                    million copies. He spent most of his early life in an orphanage, going on to work as a professor of
                    counseling
                    psychology at St. John’s University in New York City.</p><br>

                <p>After his academic lectures began to gain popularity for their focus on positive thinking, he was
                    contacted
                    by a
                    literary agent. Dyer’s first book was a huge success, and he went on to write dozens of other books,
                    including
                    many best sellers.</p><br>

                <p>He was highly influenced by Eastern Philosophy and is a great speaker to follow if you are interested
                    in
                    psychology and spirituality.Though he passed away in 2015, you can still see many of his lectures on
                    YouTube
                    and
                    his books continue to be widely popular.</p><br>
                <h2><a id="TonyRobbins"> 6. Tony Robbins</a></h2><br>
                <p>If speakers like Wayne Dyer birthed the modern motivational speaker, Tony Robbins perfected the
                    blueprint. By
                    far
                    the most successful speaker of all time, Robbins’ early books, such as Unlimited Power and Awaken
                    the
                    Giant
                    Within, helped catapult him to stardom and build several companies valued at over $6 billion in
                    annual
                    sales.
                </p><br>

                <p>His <b>High-Energy Lectures</b> use principles from Neurolinguistic Programming and popular
                    psychology to
                    inspire
                    audiences worldwide. He is also widely known for his philanthropic endeavors, and his teachings are
                    typically
                    focused on health, wealth, and living a balanced life.</p><br>

                <p>If you are feeling low in energy and want someone to pull you out of a rut, Tony Robbins is a great
                    speaker
                    to
                    listen to; his audiobooks have definitely stood the test of time.</p><br>
                <h2><a id="LesBrown">7. Les Brown</a></h2><br>
                <p>
                    Les Brown is another top motivational speaker we want to make mention of. In addition to
                    motivational
